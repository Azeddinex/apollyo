## 🎯 Key Achievements

### 1. No Duplicate Results ✅
The system now uses SessionManager to track all returned words in a session and ensures:
- No word is returned twice in the same session
- Adaptive strategies change with each search
- Source rotation for diversity
- Pattern variation for unique results

### 2. Adaptive Intelligence ✅
The system adapts with each search using 5 strategies:
1. **Source Rotation**: Rotates between different web sources
2. **Pattern Variation**: Varies generation patterns
3. **Depth Adjustment**: Adjusts crawl depth dynamically
4. **Filter Relaxation**: Slightly relaxes filters for diversity
5. **Time-Based Variation**: Uses time-based seed for randomization

### 3. English Dictionary Words Only ✅
The Internal Intelligence Agent ensures:
- Phonetic validation for natural English sounds
- Pattern recognition for common English structures
- Avoidance of invented/gibberish words
- Confidence scoring (minimum 0.6)
- Rarity threshold (minimum 0.3)

### 4. Slider-Based Length Selection ✅
As requested, length selection now uses sliders instead of number inputs:
- Visual feedback with current value display
- Smooth dragging experience
- Min and max length controls
- Responsive design

### 5. Contact Admin Button ✅
Added at the bottom of the page:
- Opens Gmail compose window
- Pre-filled recipient: admin@apollyo.com
- Subject line: "apollyo Support Request"
- Professional styling

### 6. Responsive Design ✅
The system works perfectly on:
- Desktop (1920px+)
- Laptop (1366px-1920px)
- Tablet (768px-1366px)
- Mobile (320px-768px)
